    <h1>Happy National Flowers Day</h1>
    <p>
      From the moment I met you, I was captivated,<br />
      Addicted to your laughter, attracted in ways I can't explain.<br />
      I care about you more than words can convey,<br />
      Think of you constantly, appreciate you more each day.<br /><br />
    
      You're the melody in my every thought,<br />
      The poetry that dances in my heart's core,<br />
      Your voice, a symphony of love and grace,<br />
      Your presence, a masterpiece in every space.<br /><br />
    
      No matter the distance that separates us,<br />
      My thoughts always find their way back to you,<br />
      In every sight, sound, scent, taste, and touch,<br />
      Reminders of you, my love, ever so much.<br /><br />
    
      Happy National Flowers Day, Mycha,<br />
      May this day be as beautiful as you are,<br />
      A celebration of love, in every bloom and hue,<br />
      Forever grateful for the gift of loving you.
